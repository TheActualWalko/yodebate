- Users on small screens are not aware that they have to submit an opening statement before sending the link
  - Grouping position statement and opening statements is one possible solution

- Textarea fails to expand when content is longer than two lines

- FF issues (might need to build to ES5)

- No indication of opponent activity 

- User did not offer an incompatible view as their position statement:

  "It is fair to assume the world is flat." can be true along with "It is fair to assume the world is spherical with a certain circumference and mas" [sic]



# Feature Ideas/other stuff

- Search/Indexing for people who just want to read debates

- Find a way to support "Devil's advocate"-type positions
  - With your identity attached to every post, you will be disinclined to take on positions that you don't really believe
  - This will prevent certain interesting types of discussions from happening, e.g. debates that test a viewpoint everyone agrees with by taking a contrarian position for the sake of argument
  - To accomplish this without opening the floodgates (allowing anonymous posting) we can preface every message on the contrarian's side with a note indicating their true alignment on the issue. "This user is playing devil's advocate and does not actually support the side for which they are arguing." 
  - May be a good idea to sneak this in to any copy-pasting of the user's statements.
