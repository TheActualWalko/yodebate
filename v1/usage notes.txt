- Users on small screens are not aware that they have to submit an opening statement before sending the link
  - Grouping position statement and opening statements is one possible solution

- Textarea fails to expand when content is longer than two lines

- FF issues (might need to build to ES5)

- No indication of opponent activity 

- User did not offer an incompatible view as their position statement:

  "It is fair to assume the world is flat." can be true along with "It is fair to assume the world is spherical with a certain circumference and mas" [sic]



# Feature Ideas/other stuff

- Search/Indexing for people who just want to read debates

- Indexing for "all of my debates"

- Paste a link to a user's profile to allow only them to become the responder

- Debate Proposal: state a position, and everyone who bites at it starts a new debate with you.
  - This can be the single way that debates work!! This solves the 'select a responder' problem - just continue the debate that your responder starts
  - Debates are now a child of a "proposal" or something; one proposal contains many responses.
    - A user creates a proposal with only a position statement
    - Shares the link
    - Monitors responses (which contain a position statement and a hidden opening statement)
    - Writes an opening statement responding to the position statements that he or she finds most compelling
    - And then is able to see the responder's opening statement and begin the debate.
    - Sort of like "tinder for disagreements"

- Find a way to support "Devil's advocate"-type positions
  - With your identity attached to every post, you will be disinclined to take on positions that you don't really believe
  - This will prevent certain interesting types of discussions from happening, e.g. debates that test a viewpoint everyone agrees with by taking a contrarian position for the sake of argument
  - To accomplish this without opening the floodgates (allowing anonymous posting) we can preface every message on the contrarian's side with a note indicating their true alignment on the issue. "This user is playing devil's advocate and does not actually support the side for which they are arguing." 
  - May be a good idea to sneak this in to any copy-pasting of the user's statements.
