- No indication of opponent activity 

- User did not offer an incompatible view as their position statement:

  "It is fair to assume the world is flat." can be true along with "It is fair to assume the world is spherical with a certain circumference and mas" [sic]



# Feature Ideas/other stuff

Top priorities:

  - "Who are you" modal with selection of default profile pictures (for reddit users)
    "it looks like you came from reddit. to make it easier for others to follow the discussion, you may want to use your reddit username"

  - Debate Proposal: state a position, and everyone who bites at it starts a new debate with you.
    - This can be the single way that debates work!! This solves the 'select a responder' problem - just continue the debate that your responder starts
    - Debates are now a child of a "proposal" or something; one proposal contains many responses.
      - A user creates a proposal with only a position statement
      - Shares the link
      - Monitors responses (which contain a position statement and a hidden opening statement)
      - Writes an opening statement responding to the position statements that he or she finds most compelling
      - And then is able to see the responder's opening statement and begin the debate.
      - Sort of like "tinder for disagreements"

Secondary priorities:
  
  - Error handling: invalid debate, invalid author, invalid statement

  - Indexing for "all of my debates"

  - Search/Indexing for people who just want to read debates

Distant/partially-formed plans:

  - Find a way to support "Devil's advocate"-type positions
    - With your identity attached to every post, you will be disinclined to take on positions that you don't really believe
    - This will prevent certain interesting types of discussions from happening, e.g. debates that test a viewpoint everyone agrees with by taking a contrarian position for the sake of argument
    - To accomplish this without opening the floodgates (allowing anonymous posting) we can preface every message on the contrarian's side with a note indicating their true alignment on the issue. "This user is playing devil's advocate and does not actually support the side for which they are arguing." 
    - May be a good idea to sneak this in to any copy-pasting of the user's statements.

  - Find sources without leaving the app, using suggested indexes of scientific studies and reporting.
